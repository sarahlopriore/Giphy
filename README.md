# Giphy

This project is a simple gif generator using the Giphy API.

The buttons at the top of the screen represent search queries of differnt fruits and vegetables used with the Giphy API.

Simply click a button, and the page will be populated with 10 static gifs related to that button topic.

If you click a static gif, it will become animated. Clicking an animated gif, will cause it to revert to a static gif.

Using the input box to the right, you are able to add addtional buttons that will be functional upon creation.
